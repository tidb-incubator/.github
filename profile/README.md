# TiDB Incubator Program

TiDB Incubator Program is inspired by the CNCF incubating process. The process is designed to ensure that new projects have correct licensing, up-to-date boilerplate documents, a healthy community process.

All programs should follow the incubating process to start a project. Once going through the incubation process, they can be moved from [TiDB Incubator](https://github.com/tidb-incubator) to
* [TiDB Incubator Graduated](https://github.com/tidb-incubator-graduated) organization.
* their own organization.
* PingCAP organization. But this need to be approved by the ToC.

The projects in TiDB Incubator Program are in the **experimental stage** and are not recommended for use in production environments.

For more details on the application process, please see [here](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/incubator/README.md#content).
